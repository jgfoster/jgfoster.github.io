Here is my final,
I had the files in there own folders respective to what they were originally but since D2l doesn't support file structures I modified the code and you should be able to throw everything into a folder and Open BlockRunner.html
I commented out one of the obstacles because it was giving me a little bit of a random bug. If you uncomment it and make sure it is called in the generate function it should work fine but you don't have to do that and you might experience a little bit of a bug.
Also, the GUI is static so if you are not in full screen or have a small monitor you might not be able to see everything. I tried to put everything in a decently neutral spot. 
I would have put this all on GitHub, and some of it is there, but the song is copyrighted so I thought it would be best to send it to you this way.
Have good couple weeks!
